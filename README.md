# chat
This is a chat Room App using Flutter Framework and Firebase SDK as a Back-End
packages used(Firestore to store and stream the data, Firebase Auth for handling user authentication, Firebase storage to store user images,
Image Picker to use the device native camer, and FCM for Push Notifications)

Feel free to see the code and run it. just create a new firebase project add your Firebase SDK configuration, your google-services.json File.



**Note this project is using old Firebase SDK packages versions so u will need to use Flutter Version 1.22.6 to avoid any dependencies errors.**

**Note due to using old Firebase SDK version and packages, you should leave the dependency classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3' of the build.gradle file 
version to 4.3.3 as it is and do not use a higher version to avoid potential errors and crashes*
